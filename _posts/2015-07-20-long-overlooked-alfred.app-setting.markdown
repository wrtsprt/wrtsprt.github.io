I just recently came across a setting in Alfred.app that I hadn't seen before.
If you open the Alfred settings, and click on 'Advanced', you'll find the history
settings. For some reasons those were turned off for me, and I turned them on.

This means after opening Alfred with 'Arrow up' I can get the history back.
But this also solves a major annoyance that I was facing. I often use the Alfred
calculator to do small calculations. More often than not, I don't have all the values
visible, when I open Alfred, meaning I have to type them and close Alfred and reopen
it. Guess what: now Alfred remembers what I had typed and I can just continue where
I left off.
